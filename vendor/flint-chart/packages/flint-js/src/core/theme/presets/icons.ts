/**
 * The houses at 16 pixels.
 *
 * A theme picker has to say what a house *looks like* before the reader has
 * seen a chart in it, and a word cannot: "Economist" and "Datawrapper" are both
 * blue bars on white to anyone who has not met them. So each icon is a tiny
 * chart drawn in the house's own decisions — its canvas, the first three of its
 * categorical set, the weight of its rules — rather than an invented glyph.
 * Nothing here is a colour the house does not already use.
 *
 * They are authored in one file on purpose. An icon set is only legible as a
 * set: what makes each one recognisable is the thing it does that its
 * neighbours do not, and that can only be judged side by side. At this size
 * there is room for exactly one such difference each, so every house gets one
 * and only one:
 *
 *   flint          no house at all — one flat grey trio, no signature
 *   nyt            a black headline bar over the plot, the way its charts lead
 *   economist      the red flag, top left
 *   nature         a bare black L of axis and thin journal bars, no grid
 *   mckinsey       bars laid horizontally, the deck-chart posture
 *   datawrapper    horizontal grid ruling read through the bars
 *   powerbi        the dark canvas
 *   powerbi-light  the same bright series on white, with a faint grid
 *   swiss          heavy structural black rules on warm paper
 *   pop            process-colour quadrants divided by heavy black ink
 *   cartoon        rounded bar tops and a thick soft outline
 *
 * Each is a complete SVG document so a caller can put it straight in an `<img>`
 * or inline it. 16×16 with a half-pixel inset frame: the frame is what lets a
 * white house read as a *tile* rather than as marks floating on the toolbar.
